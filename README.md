# Vendstor

Vendstor is an advanced Windows Point Of Sale App. It enables you to sell, manage employees, inventory and insight management. 

### Background History

When I was 15, after mastering C# I wanted to create something new and useful. I knew someone having a retail store with a lot of difficulties to manage them. I spoke with them about the advantages of having a modern POS. So I went developing something unique for their Business.
After a couple of months, it turned out there won't be able to use the System. Over time, I was thinking of building something similar for other businesses. But It was kind of complicated to use a PC since Tablet POSs are easier to work with. That's why I decided to develop a completely new system. Unfortunately, the Store itself couldn't use the system. 

To valorize the time, energy and the love I put in there, I open-sourced it. You can download it modify it for your own business or even develop a system with it. 

I'm currently cleaning up the code. It will soon be live, I have to remove some unwanted stuff. I might even have to redesign the Database.
